This is a Data Mining project I worked on alongside Dominic Pham and Mason Ward as a part of our
Data Mining course as a part of the Honours Bachelor of Computer Science program at Conestoga college.

In this project we used Open Data from the Government of Canada to analyze and make a tool(machine learning model)
for assisting in auditing discretionary government expenses.
